# Voting App
### "Build a Voting App" is a requirement for freeCodeCamp's Back End Development Certification: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app

**Date Completed: TBA**

See the project on Heroku at: https://charmed-urls.herokuapp.com/

>1. **Objective**: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

>2. Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

>3. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

>4. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

>5. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

>6. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

>7. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

>8. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

>9. **User Story**: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

>10. **User Story**: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

>11. **User Story**: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

>12. Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.

>13. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
